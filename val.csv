Alan Sepinwall,Rolling Stone,Top Critic,Rotten,"Even with these various smart deviations from the source material, the show‚Äôs first season is middling drama at best.

The production is of high quality and it's a good team, the producers also have shown before that they are great at adapting great source materials and books (when they exist!). Unfortunately a lot of people are just hating this show because of being still mad at the producers or some people expected this to be super-faithful to the books (which would've resulted in 30 hours of boring TV for just the first book like the Tencent version)...",,4.5,2024-03-21

The core characters being a friend group of westerners means a lot of the core message and meaning is therefore lost. Still watchable and entertaining however.

What disappoints me the most is that the creators fail to grasp the original theme's tone, turning a global crisis into what seems like a small group's game, reflecting how narrow-minded the creators' worldview is.

Don't listen to critics who are hating on this. The Old GOT showrunners have done an amazing job, this show is thought provoking, the budget is absolutely there and it's one of the coolest Sci Fi's story so far that i've watched since ""The Expanse"".

Dani J,N/A,Audience,,"If you don't choose to watch 3 Body Problem you really aren't missing out on anything. The characters are all poorly written, the dialogue makes the Oxford 5 sound like a bunch of Sheldon Coopers, and the only redeeming quality is the visuals. This show is millennial cringe from start to finish. The main characters are practically carbon-copies of one other: Da Shi and Auggie smoke cigarettes, Saul smokes weed and does acid, Jess takes Xanax, Jack is a cigar aficionado, practically all of Will's scenes are while he's high on weed or painkillers. The audience is supposed to think of these characters as relatable yet extraordinary, they're cool geniuses, they're young and successful. Including minor characters, basically everyone in this show constantly makes jokes or is the joke. Not one character that Weiss, Benioff, or Woo have created show any depth whatsoever. The dialogue tries so hard to convince us that these people are smart. They throw references to philosophical ideas like Occam's razor in scenes where it doesn't really make sense just to reinforce it. The characters awkwardly use the word ""observe"" as a synonym to ""look"" in casual conversation. Everyone talks like a dumb person's idea of what smart people sound like. It was honestly difficult to watch this show with how bad the dialogue gets; instead of feeling a sense of existential dread that the writers want me to feel, I felt extremely bored and distanced from what I was watching.",,0.5,2024-03-22

Hang C,N/A,Audience,,"They have done a fairly good job adapting and added a few extra characters/storylines without feeling like a departure from the book. Knowing the source material probably helped with understanding some of its core concepts without any issue. But I cannot say if going in all fresh would yield identical experience. Having said that, there are still quite an amount of discrepancies in the atmosphere in this one. In the book, people in general follow this crisis with a mindset of equation solving. They understand what is at stake and is almost determined to do what is necessary. The series added some personal struggles, like morality or discussions of individuality vs collectivity. While I understand it is humanizing and ""normal"" , it does feel a little fartsy in a hard sci-fi of this scale.",,4.0,2024-03-22

The breakneck narrative pace also dilutes character depth.

Both the heroes and villains come across as quite caricatured. While the characters are touted to have diverse cultural backgrounds and personality differences, they all belongs to a little group, making it hard to feel how their different cultural backgrounds truly affect them.

It's always nice to see a show that breaks free from the redundant format of it's genre and do something a bit different. It has the elements of a historical drama, and it also has the elements of a crime thriller, but it's still firmly based within the sci-fi genre.

Adrian F,N/A,Audience,,"Ship slicing craziness! I enjoyed this series until I started to question why certain things happened during the show. Don't read on if you don't want to receive spoilers. There are a few things that happen in the show that seem irrational and very unlikely to happen. I was going to recommend the show to other people until I saw the ship slicing scene. Now this might be what happens in the book, but it feels so rediculous that it left me feeling annoyed with the show and in this case not following the book would have been preferred. Basically to get vital information from the humans who are helping the aliens they use a special new material to slice the ship into small slices and this includes slices up all the families on board. This felt so rediculous and laughable. For starters why not just use a swat team to get the data needed and not kill innocent people that way. Also slicing the ship could have sliced the data up. This scene felt like a scene from the movie ghost ship, where the whole crew get sliced, so not even original. The show is very interesting if you're into science fiction, so it an enjoyable watch for those reasons. It works well with the impending doom feeling that a lot of the invasion films deliver. Another major problem with it, is how everything the aliens do seems to happen to five highly intelligent friends. It's like why couldn't these things happen to different people that weren't so connected. Maybe in the book there are more characters and they simplified this for the audience. It's like one of the friends is killed by the aliens, one is sent as a brain through space, one blackmailed by the aliens to stop her invention, one becomes a sort of world leader in the resistance, one suicides because of what her mum has done. The script between the friends is pretty dreadful as well. It is still interesting to see what happens next and that is mainly because the small bad details don't stop the bigger themes being compelling viewing.",,3.5,2024-03-24

In the original books there are many concepts explored; divinity, God, physics theories etc. At least in the Chinese version the actors look and talk more like their real life counterparts would have. In this candied over version nothing is remotely believable. The cast is awful, the storyline is childishly made simple for home consumption. Why the GOT duo thought simple American minds would not comprehend complex ideas is beyond me. Granted, good science fiction is REALLY REALLY HARD! But to dumb down everything and load it up with profanities every second sentence and hire a cast walking through the parts as though lacking any belief in their own authenticity is not the solution!

Nikolas E,N/A,Audience,,"The Remembrance of the Earth's Past trilogy is one of my all time favorite series. The creativity of the Author and scope of the series blew me away. The books themselves can be dry at times, but not detached. They have a sterile beauty to them is the best way that I can describe them. They are hard to slog through at times, but are punctuated by moments of beauty and imagination that still amaze me when I think back to them. That said, there is a difference between novels and a TV adaptation, and so I think you need to give some grace to the attempt that was made on the series. They changed the characters, but kept most plot-points and the general premise. I think they went for a more approachable and wide-appealing take on the series to engage a different set of viewers, which disappointed me. I wish they would have kept the same tone of the series ---that of a detached and intellectual perspective, like Queen's Gambit or something similar--- that said, did I think it was bad? Not really. It was fine. Just fine. It was an entertaining watch, although I would say it fell considerably short of the original series. I wish they would have taken a more authentic approach to the series, even if they changed the setting towards the west, but like I said, at least it was a bit entertaining with strong visual sequences...",,3.5,2024-03-24

Let me know if I missed anything, okay? 1) They're going to send a probe that will take 200 years to reach the aliens, and close to 200 years to get back, which means the information will arrive the same time the aliens do. 2) They're going to do this, even though it's likely in 100 or 200 years we will have the technology to get there faster -- and back -- faster. 3) They're going to send a person using cryogenics, even though it's UNNECESSARY because of time dilation, because a person will hardly age at that speed relative to Earth, AND even though 4) due to that SAME time dilation, the ""astronaut"" will likely ARRIVE BACK FURTHER THAN 400 YEARS. Meanwhile, the aliens have 5) STOPPED trying to mess up our science, a plan that was WORKING, in lieu of 6) ANNOUNCING their intentions 400 YEARS in advance AND galvanizing the WORLD against them.

I watched it with my wife who isn't too much versed in science and didn't read the books, it's alright I could explain the major concepts, the show ""dumbed it down"" a little and it's well executed in my opinion, enough for a majority of people to understand and even then, does it really matter ?

doreen z,N/A,Audience,,"As a reader of the book, I was pleasantly surprised by the adaptation. While some reviews express disappointment in how the show deviates from the original characters or plot, or fails to capture its wild ideas, I believe the TV series perfects the book as a ""story."" The series delves into the depth of characters and their motives. I always thought the characters in the original book served more as tools to progress the plot or tools for threading together ideas. Many of them had one-dimensional motives, beliefs, or even personalities. The TV series portrays the characters as more multi-dimensional individuals. The addition of ties between the main characters that don‚Äôt exist in the book also adds depth to their motives and emotions. The sequence of events is also presented in a much more engaging manner. I particularly enjoyed the fragmented storytelling of Dr. Ye‚Äôs past, instead of being told as a single chunk in a random cafe. The pre-debut of the Staircase program also acted as a great set up to a major plot in the later story. Not to mention the small foreshadowing planted across the episodes. The TV series also addresses ‚Äúplot holes‚Äù that many fans questioned, such as why Santi allowed the Nami threads plan or why was Dr. Ye allowed to reveal the secret in such an explicit manner in the book. Lastly, the visuals are just absolutely stunning and align perfectly with how I imagined them while reading the book. I can't wait for season 2 to come out!",,4.5,2024-03-24

The TV mini series did more justice to the source material but just wasn‚Äôt quite there in production values (the constraints of a TV budget, alas). Dune, part 1 was tough because it was almost all set up and Dune part 2 was a vastly satisfying conclusion. There are multiple aspects of the original that aren‚Äôt covered well or even covered at all in the movie. Unfortunately some things that are large aspects may not transfer well to the screen.

Patrick R,N/A,Audience,,"I absolutely loved this show, and loved how it incorporated the philosophical aspects of the books. I think that many of the changes that have been made were necessary in adapting this work. I think more character work at the start of the show could have been a nice to have, allowing us to get to know the characters a bit better before plunging straight in, but I understand why this might not have been done for time and budgetary reasons. All in all, an incredible watch, with very decent acting, some funny lines here and there, and an excellent example of TV science fiction, and what it could and possibly even dare I say, of what it should, look like. As an addtional note, a lot of the criticism of this show seems to be coming from critics that don't like shows with non-constant drama and unique pacing, and while I agree that there could have been ways the show could have done better with its pacing, I think these are silly criticisms of what is overall a very interesting work. Additionally, most of the critics that seem to have read the Trilogy that this series is actually based on, seem to have enjoyed this show so far, or are optimistically holding out further hope for their few criticisms being addressed by subsequent seasons.",,5.0,2024-03-25

Somehow they've taken a bunch of creative liberties while still managing to stay true to the spirit of the books, and imo are really nailing the tone of dread that the books have. They're proving just as they did with Game of Thrones' earlier seasons how skilled they are when it comes to adapting books into live action. If you're unfamiliar with this story, I recommend giving it a try for just three episodes, by then either you're hooked or you aren't.

Sheldon T,N/A,Audience,,"I had high hopes for this title as I love the original book so much, and like the Chinese TV series. However, this one make a great sci-fi with great story settings, DEEP PHILOSOPHY and SCIENCE discussions into a plain and simple ""there's some bad alien and bad guy, let's fight them together in the group of CHOSEN ONES, and we should have complex love, sex and other relationships"" story. 1st, all characters are kind of lack of depth. Especially Ye Wenjie, who was a soul character, has very complex background and thoughts, so she once hate human, then begin to love some of the human, feeling a little conflict on welcoming the 3 body alien, but still lean towards 3 body alien may bring better things to human. In this movie, I only see hate, blind belief, and... sex? Saul Durand is the role of Luo Ji, who is key to all 3 books, however, he looks like a minor role the whole season, then at last 2 episode, suddenly push him to become a wallfacer. Auggie Salazar should be an important scientist character, but never saw she really worked on science stuff, more like an entrepreneur who drinks and smokes a lot, and always unable to resist the impulse, doesn't seem very rational. 2nd, all major storylines are very rushed, it's like suddenly some setting jumped out, without enough, or even no scenes to develop the story. Like why we choose the nano line to cut the ship, why we need wallfacer, all like from nowhere. 3rd, the details and story logic are bad. Initially, why Ye Wenjie took the blame on the forbidden book is not clear, just due to blind love on someone who betrayed her? Why is everything about a small group of people from Oxford? Just because they are THE CHOSEN ONES? Why use nano technology to cut the boat? Seems Evans doesn't want to destroy the hard drive at all, her run for mins and didn't destroy it, Just Sent SWAT TEAM! Why did Saul sit with Da Shi in an open Motel Garden after the assassin? He is eager to be killed? How does the cutting edge VR headset come from? Even though 3 body provide the design, Earth doesn't have the equipment and technology to manufacture those kinds of things yet! 4th, the visual effect is not good enough, does the universe blink like broken lights? No details on the cutting boat scene also. Last but not least, a lot of important deeper conversation are gone, mainly ALL DEEPER PHILOSOPHY and SCIENCE discussions are missing from this TV series, make the story from a great personal, social and science discussion, into a plain and simple ""there's some bad alien and bad guy, let's fight them together in the group of CHOSEN ONES"" story.",,0.5,2024-03-26

Sumeet S,N/A,Audience,,"Overall good sci-fi show. Only thing I didn't like was Eiza Gonzalez's character. But that is not a critique of series itself. A decent adaption of the novels. Quite a lot of changes had been made to make story fit for streaming. Nonetheless good one time watch. Now character of Eiza Gonzalez in this is insufferable. Her higher than thou morality gets exhausting after few episodes. She does everything everyone else is doing but with added whining. Her morality and actions doesn't match at all. SPOILERS She doesn't like the idea of killing a ship full of people but goes ahead with it. Doesn't matter that same people were responsible for her friend's murder and countless other scientists. Doesn't matter that data they had was essential for billions of people‚Äôs survival. Then she goes again to work for same people, and as soon she is done with what she was supposed to do her morality kicks in and she leaves. She is horrified at idea that people are spending money to find a way to defend against incoming attack in 400 years, instead of eliminating poverty now. So when should they start to prepare, when they see the ships in blue sky.",,4.0,2024-03-26

Craig T,N/A,Audience,,"Props to Benioff and Weiss. I love these books. And they have done an excellent job adapting the series so far. They made a LOT of ambitious changes. And most of them really work to help the story. The original story does not work on the screen, and the changes they made are all in service of something interesting to WATCH, not just interesting to READ. The character changes, the movement to a world scope as opposed to a China scope, the blending of the novels, the increased action and dramatization - all of these aid in telling the story for television. (If you've read the books and you're annoyed by the drama between the characters, think of how much better this is than Luo Ji's fictional girlfriend - there's going to be actual people involved in this subplot.) My only real critique is that some of the science makes less sense with the added spectacle. Cixin Liu writes science fiction, but he does an excellent job anchoring the science fiction in real science, which is part of what makes the book series special. The TV series still does science, but it drifts more toward the fiction end of the spectrum, which is too bad, since the science is really compelling. Please bring back some of Liu's wonderful analogies. Overall, I was very pleased, and I'm looking forward to season 2.",,4.5,2024-03-27

So yeah, it is the price we have to pay for having this trilogy made into a TV show. On the other hand, that doesn't mean the characters are dumbed down, and the core of the first book is in there.

How? In the first place, why would they cast actors from GOT? It‚Äôs baffling. None of the main team of characters are believable or convincing in their roles. It‚Äôs like watching characters from Grange Hill grown up. The impression watching is that money saved on actors has been used to fund the special effects, which are impressive. It‚Äôs like a multimillion dollar episode of Dr Who. There‚Äôs nothing so far (up to episode 4) with any real spark, nothing keeping one glued to the screen, nothing unputdownable, as with so many stunningly acted and directed, ‚Äòjust one more episode before bed‚Äô series.

Despite the flaws of the books, the first season of ‚ÄúThree Body Problem‚Äù is a gem, the best SF on TV, possibly ever: emotion, character, an accelerating plot, mystery and excellent effects, the better for being carefully placed and paced. Its SF tropes are not original, and its physics is, as far as we know, wrong in several places (even if they are places that the literature of SF has gone several times before), but the mixture is new, and hangs together. The difficulty, I guess, is that the ‚Äúwow!‚Äù moments and those delightful flashes where the science appears a minute or two after you have worked out what‚Äôs coming are skewed to those of us whi have scienced the **** out of things for far too long.",,5.0,2024-03-27

Outside of that though love how they made the source material avaliable to a wider audience by the way they adapted the story. Bringing characters from books 2 and 3 earlier on was also a very smart thing to do and will make some payoffs nicer in the later parts of the story.

So this show is almost new to me. I didn't expect I would finish it in a single day but it is this addictive. I'm not against the huge adaptations made to the novel to fit it into a fast paced tv show - it certainly is more entertaining to watch especially for the general public who's new to SanTi - but I feel it could easily be extended to 10 episodes per book volume given unlimited funding.

Sure enough, I started reading the third book before I finished the season and it was all there. I felt like there should have been a spoiler-warning for all the books in the series for the first season alone. Other than that, I liked the show. The narrative is easier to follow, but that's not always an accolade. The science in the book is dense, but fascinating. The show skims the surface of the hard science fiction of the books.

Simon K,N/A,Audience,,A really good adaption of the books. It remained true to the trippy cerebral Sifi of the original while remaining accessible to a new audience. It's clear that the writers have really considered the full 3 book story arc (which acts more as an anthology) in how they pull in characters and events from the 2nd and 3rd books to make a cast for TV capable of experiencing the full run of the narrative. If I had one small criticism it's that in the books the global efforts behind the events of the story feel really prominent and this only becomes tangible in the last episode or two. Can‚Äôt wait for season 2!,,5.0,2024-03-28
Sum Z,N/A,Audience,,"Here we have another series which showcases the immense disparity between Hollywood's reality, and the reality which average people inhabit.

With an economical script, and a lot of unknowns, I hope this is deliberately formed as a portal to Series 02, and not bad directing.

Sunday Night Streaming o,N/A,Audience,,"3 Body Problem Season 1 ‚Äì 8.4 ‚Äì Strap in for the ultimate sci-fi thrill ride! What initially hooked me was the futuristic tech, but boy, did this series deliver so much more. Picture this: governments gearing up for a battle with aliens centuries down the line. It's a premise that grabs you from the get-go. And let's talk about that ensemble cast - a reunion of sorts from the Game of Thrones crew, all under the guidance of their old director. Now, I confess, I didn't read the books, so the story was a whirlwind of imagination and boundary-pushing concepts. Mysterious deaths, genius minds, an intense video game, cult worshippers, and a grand initiative to save humanity - this show had it all, and then some. But let's address the elephant in the room - those San Ti. I was on the edge of my seat, hoping for some interaction, especially with Will, post-launch. Alas, it wasn't meant to be. But every scene that they were in I was always hoping for more. The intrigue of alien life just had me cooked, because you know we do not know what‚Äôs out there as well. Nevertheless, this series delves deep into mystery, action, and of course, sci-fi goodness. Each episode was a journey, seamlessly blending intrigue and depth. Season 2 can't come soon enough.

Tallon K,N/A,Audience,,"Very good, can't remember when I last watched a series so intently. It does an excellent job of weaving interesting individual stories back and forth into a single theme.

blue r,N/A,Audience,,"I read the book first and this comment is about some comparision between the show and the book. Overall I love the show which put live to the charachters in the book. A lot of the imaginations in the book is hard to visualize. I love the quality of the visualizations in the san-ti game, but think the pase is too fast, not enough failure to show the historical steps to gradually understanding the san-ti world. The story between Will and Jin is presented well. The show's pace is very fast which is a double edge sword since it reveals a lot of suspense in latter books. This one one side makes the actions of people easier to understand which is good for TV format's audience who does not have time to pause and digging deeper, but at the same time this change removed a lot of the suspense and mystery feeling.",,5.0,2024-03-30

Bruce R,N/A,Audience,,"I didn't read the book so I am coming in cold. I have to say I was not over the moon about this as much as everyone else. I had a lot of problems with it. For example when Evans is talking to the alien liaison through the box and she doesn't understand the Little Red Riding Hood story. You would think someone as brilliant as Evans would've been able to say ""Oh no it's not a real story. This is called a fable. It is a fictional story we tell children to teach a lesson."" There show-runners I just helped you out. That whole thing was a real eye-roll. Also, the fact there was no real build-up to this. It would've been good to see how they started talking, see the progression, etc. Same when young Ye sold our planet to the aliens. There was very little build-up to that moment. But then they literally spent half the show focusing on Will and his dying love for Jin. Episodes 6 and 7 were boring. And then the brain thing? Really? Just way too may eye-roll moments. Everyone was all hyped about the ship scene in Episode 5. Except they already did something similar to that in this movie called Ghost Ship from about 15 years ago or so. I saw a lot of borrowed ideas. Good premise, good acting, but I was not all that impressed. Too much melodrama. At times I felt like I was watching some sci-fi version of ""Singles"".",,2.5,2024-03-31

I understand that for some audiences, some part of this show so far seems boring and too focused on some individuals; however, I promise you that it will get better in the next season (i really hope that there will be a season 2 and 3). Season 1 is more like an introduction to what is going to happen next and the original novel's brilliance starts in the 2nd book. This is not like Dune or Star Wars or some other sci-fi where it's just basically a family story in a futuristic setting. This is a HARD-CORE sci-fi with a BIG picture.",,5.0,2024-03-31

The dialogues are cringy.. awful writing full of clich√©s and predictable sentences. Why does everything needs to westernised? This is a Chinese story, written by a Chinese author but most of the series was shot in the UK?! Funny how nobody thought it would make sense to be faithful to the original story.

Xiaolong H,N/A,Audience,,"While I haven't had the opportunity to read the original book, my interest in sci-fi drew me to explore ""The Three-Body Problem"" series, particularly for its intriguing exploration of extraterrestrial contact. I appreciate its narrative that ambitiously delves into the scientific, philosophical, socio-economic, and existential dimensions of such an encounter. However, I felt that the stories, scenes, and conversations lacked depth and coherence compared to the scope it tackles. The character interactions, for instance, lacked memorability, diminishing the story's impact. Moreover, the portrayal of characters, especially scientists, occasionally struck me as lacking in sophistication and depth, which seemed at odds with their professional backgrounds. From a scientific standpoint, the series hinges on a few critical concepts that, while central to the plot, appear either incorrect or highly improbable. This approach detracts from the 'hard science fiction' essence, seemingly exploring their entertainment values rather than offering a rigorous exploration of the subject matter. Overall, the employment of those sciences seems to be forced and superficial. Narratively, certain scenes and conversations felt shallow, failing to advance the storyline or carry real or deep meanings they pretentiously attempt to. Additionally, the CGI quality did not meet the expectations set by contemporary standards in the genre. While the first half of the series captured my interest more effectively, the latter segments seemed to lose momentum, affecting the overall engagement with the story. Despite these criticisms, the series' attempt to weave a multifaceted narrative around extraterrestrial contact is commendable, offering some intriguing and entertaining moments.",,3.0,2024-03-31

William V,N/A,Audience,,"I went into this series being prepared for a let-down as I was not confident the spirit of the excellent book series would be respected.

The book elicits a sort of spooky and primal fear in the reader, and the television adaptation hits these buttons perfectly. ""We will teach you to fear again."" - Sophon Everything is not perfect, however. The show suffers by heavily westernizing the original Chinese source material. Constant profanity and plenty of nudity are added because western producers cannot seem to think outside those boxes. It really hurts the believability of some scenes where these supposedly brilliant scientists argue, swear and jab at each other like a bunch of drunken teenagers. Casting is overall well-done, but the show made a terrible choice with Eiza Gonz√°lez as Auggie. This character is portrayed with a constant air of condescension and stuck-up arrogance that ruins every scene she is in. By mid-season I was thoroughly hoping she would be killed off.

Half of the overdramatized bs dialogue scenes could have been cut. This show could have been condensed to 2 movies and would have been so much better.,,4.0,2024-04-03
